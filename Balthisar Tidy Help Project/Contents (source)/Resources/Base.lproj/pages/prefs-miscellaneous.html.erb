			The <strong>Input-Encoding Helper</strong> can be set to appear when
			<em>Balthisar Tidy</em> thinks that it didn’t open a file properly.
		</p>
		<p>
			The <strong>New User Helper</strong> points out some of the features
			of <em>Balthisar Tidy</em> the first time Tidy is run. If you’d like
			to see this feature again, it can be reset here.
		</p>
		<p>
			By choosing to <strong>show alternating row colors</strong> you have control
			over whether <em>Balthisar Tidy</em> highlights every alternating row color
			in the list of Tidy options. This gives you control over the legibility and
			appearance that you’re most comfortable working with.
		</p>
		<p>
			<strong>Hovering behavior</strong> gives you the flexibility to decide whether
			to see the Tidy options as nice clean text without row upon row of controls,
			or to see the options in the traditional format with the option selector
			(the pop up list or stepper control) always present.
