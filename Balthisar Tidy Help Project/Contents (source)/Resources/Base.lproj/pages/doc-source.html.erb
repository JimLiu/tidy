<h1>Tidy’s Source HTML Pane</h1>
<p>
	<em>Balthisar Tidy</em> Tidy’s the text in the “Source HTML” pane.
	When you <a href="how-open-document.html">open an existing document</a>
	its text will be present in this pane.
</p>
<p>
	Alternatively you can <a href="how-create-new.html">create a blank document</a>
	and begin adding HTML markup in this area directly.
</p>
<div class="center-content"><div><div><img src="../images/doc-source.png" alt="source pane"/></div></div></div>

<p>
	It’s often convenient to make quick-and-dirty, valid HTML documents
	by typing directly into this window without opening documents. We don’t
	recommend making this your primary HTML document editor, however, as
	there are many full-featured editors more adequate for working with text.
