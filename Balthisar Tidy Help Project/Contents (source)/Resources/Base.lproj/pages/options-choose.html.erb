			Tidy offers many options for cleaning your HTML, correcting errors, identifying
			accessibility issues, and more. All of the available options are available in
			the document window pane labeled “Tidy Options,” as shown to the left.
		</p>
		<p>
			Although you can select option values the standard way with the mouse, <em>Balthisar
			Tidy</em> makes it easy for keyboard users to choose options, too. When the list of
			options is focused (by either clicking into it our using the <kbd>tab</kbd> key),
			you can move up and down the list with the up- and down-arrow keyboard keys.
		</p>
		<p>
			You can also use the left- and right-arrow keyboard keys to select option values for
			most of <em>Balthisar Tidy</em>’s settings. And of course you will see the results in
			the Tidy HTML view almost immediately!
