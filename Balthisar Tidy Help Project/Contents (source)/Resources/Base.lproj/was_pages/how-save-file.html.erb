<h1>Save a File</h1>
<p>
	Depending on the behavior set in <a href="prefs-file-saving.html">Preferences</a>,
	you may have to use the <strong>Save As…</strong> menu item in the
	<strong>File</strong> menu to save your file. If you save a file and see
	the message below:
</p>

<img src="../images/save-save-as-required.png" alt="alert window" class="maxW420px"/>

<p>
	Or this message, below:
</p>

<img src="../images/save-save-warning.png" alt="alert window" class="maxW420px"/>

<p>
	…then you can be sure that <em>Balthisar Tidy</em> is set to ensure
	against any possible data loss as a result of its work.
</p>

<p>
	Data loss is very unlikely, but as Tidy is very, very strict it’s
	possible that it will remove content that it thinks is garbage. For
	this reason it’s always important to
	<a href="how-view-error-table.html">review the Tidy Messages table</a>.
