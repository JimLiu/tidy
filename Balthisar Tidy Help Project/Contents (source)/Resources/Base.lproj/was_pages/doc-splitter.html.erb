<h1>Tidyâ€™s Document Window Panel Sizing Splitter</h1>
<p>
	<em>Balthisar Tidy</em> displays a lot of information in a single document window,
	and not all of this information is important to you all the time. As such the
	document window is resizable and reconfigurable. Even better, this configuration
	is remembered for you each time you open a new document, even after quitting and
	restarting <em>Balthisar Tidy</em>.
</p>
<p>
	There are a total of four splitter bars between each of the panels in the document
	window. They may be difficult to see, but you will notice that your mouse pointer
	changes shape as it hovers or passes over the borders. Simply grab and drag the
	splitters until the view is how you want it to be.
