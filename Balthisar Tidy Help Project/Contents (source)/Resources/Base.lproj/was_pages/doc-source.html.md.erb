Tidy’s Source HTML Pane
=======================

_Balthisar Tidy_ Tidy’s the text in the “Source HTML” pane. When you
[open a document] its text will be present in this pane.

Alternatively you can [create a blank document] and begin adding HTML
markup in this area directly.

![Source HTML Pane]{: .maxW1660px }

It’s often convenient to make quick-and-dirty, valid HTML documents
by typing directly into this window without opening documents. We don’t
recommend making this your primary HTML document editor, however, as
there are many full-featured editors more adequate for working with text.
