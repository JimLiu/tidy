==============================

To print your Tidy’d source code, Use the **Open…** menu item in the **File**
menu. You will have access to all of the standard Mac OS X features for your
particular printer, including the ability to save as a PDF.

***Note***: _Balthisar Tidy_ will honor all of your Tidy options, including
settings such as `wrap`. If you have very long lines and `wrap` is 0 (meaning no
wrap at all) or is set to a very high value, then _Balthisar Tidy_ will shrink
the output in order to accomodate the page size. This may result in very tiny
text.
