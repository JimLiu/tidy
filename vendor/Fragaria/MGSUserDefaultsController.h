/**
 *  The MGSUserDefaultsController and its related class are intended to
 *  function as replacements for NSUserDefaults and NSUserDefaultsController,
 *  principally adding the benefit of being able to manage multiple sets of
 *  the same defaults keys for multiple instances of an object. This can be
 *  particularly useful when binding to user-interface controls.
 *
 *  In order to support shared defaults, i.e., a default that serves as a master
 *  for multiple instances, there's also a global default. For example if you
 *  wish to ensure that multiple text views' `backgroundColor` is shared, you
 *  can specify that that `backgroundColor` is a global property.
 *
 *  In general user defaults managed by this class are not compatible with
 *  NSUserDefaults. It's certainly possible to use NSUserDefaults to change
 *  or read managed keys, but there's not much point.
